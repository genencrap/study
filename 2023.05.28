convolution
 continuous convolution
 discrete convolution
 2d image convolution
 
 k(3*3 filter) * i(7*7 image) = output(5*5)
                   -> tensor
32*32*3 -> conv(4 5*5*3 filters), ReLU -> 28*28*4 -> conv(10 5*5*4 filter), ReLU -> 24*24*10 -> 

convolutional neral networks
cnn consists of convolution layer, pooling layer, and fully connected layer.
convolution and pooling layers: feature extraction
full connected layer:decision making (e.g classification)
